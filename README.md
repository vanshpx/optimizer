# NextStep — AI Travel Itinerary Optimizer

> **Tell us where you want to go. We'll plan the perfect trip — and adapt it when things change.**

NextStep is an AI-powered travel planning system. You describe your trip in plain English — destination, dates, budget, interests — and it builds a fully optimized, day-by-day itinerary. If something goes wrong during the trip (bad weather, crowded attraction, traffic jam), the system re-plans on the fly without losing your preferences.

The frontend is a web dashboard for travel agents to create and monitor itineraries. The backend is a Python pipeline that uses mathematical optimization (FTRM + Ant Colony Optimization) to score and route attractions.

---

## What It Does

### 1. Plan Generation (Chat → Itinerary)

You provide your travel details through a guided form + free-text chat:

- **Hard constraints**: destination, dates, budget, number of travelers
- **Soft preferences**: "I love history and street food", "avoid crowded places", "kid-friendly"

The system then:

1. **Extracts constraints** from your input (NLP keyword extraction + optional LLM)
2. **Allocates budget** across accommodation, food, attractions, transport
3. **Fetches & scores attractions** using the FTRM model — each attraction gets a composite score based on your interests, proximity, cost, and time fit
4. **Optimizes the route** using Ant Colony Optimization — finds the best order to visit stops each day, minimizing travel time while maximizing satisfaction
5. **Outputs a day-by-day itinerary** with times, durations, travel legs, and budget breakdown

### 2. Real-Time Re-Optimization (During the Trip)

Once a trip is in progress, the system monitors conditions and adapts:

| Disruption | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **Crowd surge** at next stop | Reschedules to a quieter time, moves to tomorrow, or suggests alternatives |
| **Bad weather** (rain, storm, fog) | Blocks unsafe outdoor stops, re-routes to indoor alternatives |
| **Traffic jam** ahead | Defers high-value stops for later, replaces low-value ones |
| **Traveler is hungry** | Inserts a restaurant break from nearby options |
| **Traveler is tired** | Reduces remaining stops, prioritizes rest |
| **User skips/dislikes a stop** | Removes it and rebuilds the remaining plan |

Every change goes through a **confirmation gate** — the system proposes a decision, and the user (or travel agent) approves, rejects, or modifies it before anything changes.

### 3. Multi-Agent System

Four specialized agents work together through an event bus:

- **State Agent** — tracks trip position, visited stops, time, budget
- **Monitoring Agent** — watches for crowd/weather/traffic thresholds
- **Re-optimization Agent** — replans when disruptions are detected
- **Companion Agent** — handles user-facing communication and approvals

### 4. Web Dashboard (Frontend)

A Next.js web interface for travel agents:

- **Landing page** — product overview
- **Itinerary builder** — form-based trip creation (destination, dates, client details, hotels, activities)
- **Dashboard** — list of all itineraries with status, upcoming timeline, and "needs attention" alerts
- **Trip view** — day-by-day itinerary with map, activity cards, and live ops panel

## Getting Started

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanshpx/NextStep.git
cd NextStep
docker-compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) |
| Backend API | [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) |
| Swagger Docs | [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) |

### Option B: Manual Setup

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+ and Node.js 18+

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx prisma generate
```

---

## Usage

### Generate an Itinerary (CLI)

The CLI is the fastest way to try the pipeline. No API keys needed — all external services are stubbed by default.

```bash
cd backend

# Quick run — uses default stub data for Delhi
python main.py

# Interactive — answer form questions + describe preferences in chat
python main.py --chat

# Full experience — generate itinerary, then simulate disruptions
python main.py --chat --reoptimize
```

**Example session:**

```
Destination city: Jaipur
Departure city: Delhi
Departure date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2026-04-01
Return date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2026-04-04
Number of adults: 2
Total budget (INR): 50000

Describe your preferences (type 'done' when finished):
> We love history and architecture. Want to see old forts and palaces.
> Also interested in local street food and markets.
> done

[Stage 1] Constraints extracted: destination=jaipur, 3 days, budget=50000 INR
[Stage 2] Budget allocated: Accommodation 35%, Attractions 20%, Food 15% ...
[Stage 3] 12 attractions scored and ranked
[Stage 4] ACO optimized route across 3 days

=== DAY 1 (2026-04-01) ===
  09:00  Amber Fort (120 min) — score: 0.87
  11:30  Nahargarh Fort (90 min) — score: 0.82
  13:30  Lunch break
  ...
```

### Interactive Re-Optimizer

After generating an itinerary, the `--reoptimize` flag drops you into an interactive session:

```
Commands:
  crowd <pct>     — Simulate crowd at next stop (e.g., crowd 80)
  weather <cond>  — Simulate weather (e.g., weather thunderstorm)
  traffic <pct>   — Simulate traffic delay (e.g., traffic 60)
  skip            — Skip the next stop
  replace         — Replace next stop with alternative
  hungry          — Trigger hunger disruption
  tired           — Trigger fatigue disruption
  continue        — Advance to next stop normally
  approve/reject  — Respond to pending decisions
  summary         — Show current trip state
  end             — Exit
```

### Run the API Server

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn api.server:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Run the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Run the Demo (No Input Needed)

A scripted walkthrough of 6 re-optimization scenarios with plain-English explanations:

```bash
cd backend
python demo_reoptimizer.py
```

## How It Works (Technical Overview)

### The FTRM Scoring Model

Every attraction gets a satisfaction score $S_{pti} \in [0,1]$ for each time slot:

$$S_{pti} = HC_{pti} \times SC_{pti}$$

- **$HC_{pti}$** (Hard Constraints) — binary gate. If the attraction is closed, too far, or violates accessibility requirements → score = 0.
- **$SC_{pti}$** (Soft Constraints) — weighted sum of interest match, proximity, cost fit, time fit, and popularity. Higher = better match for the traveler.

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

Once attractions are scored, ACO finds the optimal visiting order:

1. Virtual "ants" explore different route permutations
2. Each ant picks the next stop based on: $P_{ij} = \frac{\tau_{ij}^\alpha \cdot \eta_{ij}^\beta}{\sum \tau_{ij}^\alpha \cdot \eta_{ij}^\beta}$
   - $\tau$ = pheromone (learned from previous good routes)
   - $\eta$ = heuristic (attraction score / travel time)
3. Best routes get more pheromone → convergence on optimal solution
4. Repeated per day, respecting time budget (default: 10 hours/day)
